# QIIME2: Amplicon Sequence Analysis

## Overview

QIIME2 is an open-source platform designed to analyze and interpret microbiome data from amplicon sequencing experiments, particularly 16S, 18S, and ITS ribosomal RNA gene sequences. It allows researchers to process raw sequencing data, perform various analyses, and generate publication-ready visualizations and reports.

## Purpose of QIIME2

QIIME2 simplifies the complex process of microbial community analysis by providing:
- **Data management:** QIIME2 organizes and tracks data provenance (metadata, commands, etc.), ensuring that results are reproducible.
- **Analysis pipeline:** From raw sequence data, QIIME2 offers steps such as quality filtering, denoising, taxonomic assignment, diversity analysis, and more.
- **Visualization:** The platform includes rich visualization capabilities, which help researchers explore their results interactively.

## Key Features of QIIME2

- **Extensibility:** QIIME2 supports a wide range of plug-ins for different types of microbial data analyses.
- **Reproducibility:** QIIME2's semantic framework ensures that all analyses can be traced and reproduced.
- **Community Support:** QIIME2 is continuously updated with new features and tools contributed by the bioinformatics community.

## Methodology

QIIME2 follows a modular approach that includes several core steps for analyzing microbiome data:
1. **Importing data:** Raw sequence data is imported into QIIME2's unique format (QZA).
2. **Quality filtering:** Denoising algorithms like DADA2 are applied to clean the data.
3. **Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs):** Clustering sequences into OTUs or Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs).
4. **Taxonomic assignment:** Assigning taxonomic labels to sequences using reference databases.
5. **Alpha and beta diversity:** Calculating within-sample (alpha) and between-sample (beta) diversity metrics.
6. **Visualization:** Creating visual representations such as bar plots, heat maps, and interactive 3D scatter plots.

## Installation and Setup Guide for Miniconda and QIIME2 (Amplicon Analysis) on macOS

### Step 1: Create a directory for Miniconda installation
Open your terminal and run the following command to create a directory for Miniconda:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/miniconda3
```

### Step 2: Download the Miniconda installer
Download the latest Miniconda installer for macOS (ARM64) to the newly created directory:

```bash
curl https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.sh -o ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
```

### Step 3: Install Miniconda
Run the installer in silent mode:

```bash
bash ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/miniconda3
```

### Step 4: Clean up
Remove the installer to save space:

```bash
rm -rf ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
```

### Step 5: Verify installation
Check if Conda was installed correctly by checking the version:

```bash
conda --version
```

You should see the installed version of Conda (e.g., `conda 4.x.x`).

### Step 6: Check directories and files
Ensure that Miniconda has been installed in the right directory by listing the contents:

```bash
ls ~/miniconda3
```

### Step 7: Update Conda
Itâ€™s important to update Conda to the latest version:

```bash
conda update conda
```

### Step 8: Update all packages
Update all Conda packages to their latest versions:

```bash
conda update --all
```

### Step 9: Clean up unnecessary cached files
To clean up unused cached files, run:

```bash
conda clean --all
```

---

## Initialize Conda

To activate and use Conda, you must initialize it. Run the following command to initialize Conda for the `bash` shell:

```bash
~/miniconda3/bin/conda init bash
```

After initialization, close the terminal and open a new terminal window. You should see the base Conda environment `(base)` in your terminal prompt.

---

## Step 10: Verify the environment
Once the terminal has restarted, update Conda again to ensure everything is up to date:

```bash
conda update conda
```

---

## Step 11: Install necessary tools
Install `wget`, a tool for downloading files from the web:

```bash
conda install wget
```

---

## Step 12: Download the QIIME2 environment file
Download the environment file for QIIME2 amplicon analysis (version 2024.5):

```bash
wget https://data.qiime2.org/distro/amplicon/qiime2-amplicon-2024.5-py39-osx-conda.yml
```

---

## Step 13: Create the QIIME2 environment
Use the downloaded YAML file to create the QIIME2 environment:

```bash
conda env create -n qiime2-amplicon-2024.5 --file qiime2-amplicon-2024.5-py39-osx-conda.yml
```

---

## Step 14: Activate the QIIME2 environment
Activate the newly created QIIME2 environment:

```bash
conda activate qiime2-amplicon-2024.5
```

---

## Step 15: Verify QIIME2 installation
Check if QIIME2 was installed correctly by running:

```bash
qiime --help
```

This should display a list of QIIME2 commands, indicating that the installation was successful.

---

## Step 16: Open Jupyter notebook to run QIIME2

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
